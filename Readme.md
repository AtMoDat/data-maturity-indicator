# Data Maturity Indicator

The Data Maturity Indicator is a draft extension to the DataCite Metadata Schema. The Data Maturity Indicator would allow to place the results of data maturity checks in the DataCite Metadata in a standardized format. Currently (DataCite Metadata Schema v4.3), such information can only be provided via `relatedIdentifier`.

The conept does only provide metadata fields to insert maturity information. No maturity matrix/metric/measure is suggested. Thus, this concept is open to any kind of maturity measure.

The draft containing the definition of metadata property and sub-properties is provided as `*.csv` file. A `*.xml` file hosts an example usage of the Data Maturity Indicator.

This Readme will be extended during May and June 2020 and further examples will be added.
